# Content
Much of the content for the landing page was supplied by a pre-existing business plan and pitch deck, created by site author, Luke. This includes everything from company description, tag line copy, use-cases, product descriptions, and team bios.

## Other
### Keywords
The keywords chosen for the landing are based on generally accepted suggestions for SEO marketing. A health mix of broad, specific, and long-tail keywords are used. They were generated by Bard after providing it the full company business plan.

## Changes and Challenges
### Borders vs Cards
One major was the overall look and feel of the site. While attempting to introduce cards and containers in order to provide more modern styling, and make the site look and feel less "HTML-y", cards, borders, and shadows were introcude. The first settled upon iteration look as follows:

While this looked good, it still felt like it needed improvement. Therefore, eliminating borders, introducing subtle shadows, and changing the body background give it more depth:

### Links vs Buttons
Another challenge was the wabpack styling taking over the styling of buttons which were meant to simply link to other pages, as can be seen at the bottom of the screenshot below. The button would look fine were it not for the text getting styling as a link inside the button. The purpose of the buttons was to prompt users to navigate to the next section of the website, offering a logical flow which would result in a sign-up. However, in the interest of time, we'll hide the buttons to reintroduce later.

### Link breaks vs CSS
Throughout the code, there are a few line breaks to provide additional spacing between elemenst. In the future, it would be worth the effort to see if in the interest of correctness, these line breaks could be replaced with proper padding and margin.

## Won't Do
There were three tasks which were deemed not necessary due to their being largely aesthetic, less important than other fixes, and therefore deprioritized than other adjustments which needed to be made in order to make the deadline.

### Social Media links
In some views, particularly those on larger viewports, the social media links began to be space across the inter footer, which doesn't look nice.

### Terms of Service, Privacy Protection, Copyright
As with the social media links, this was also deprioritize. However, adding these links and functionality could be coupled with a redesign of the social media links, as both share the footer.

### List styles
Some of the lists may perhaps have appeared more readable if their were either in a centered container with left-align, or in the case of the Bermadinho Disaster, place into a table with the left coloumn being aligned right and the right column being aligned left:

Color could have also been added to the left column to provie better readability, as well.
