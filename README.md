## Changes and Challenges
### Borders vs Cards
One major was the overall look and feel of the site. While attempting to introduce cards and containers in order to provide more modern styling, and make the site look and feel less "HTML-y", cards, borders, and shadows were introcude. The first settled upon iteration look as follows:

While this looked good, it still felt like it needed improvement. Therefore, eliminating borders, introducing subtle shadows, and changing the body background give it more depth:

### Links vs Buttons
Another challenge was the wabpack styling taking over the styling of buttons which were meant to simply link to other pages, as can be seen at the bottom of the screenshot below. The button would look fine were it not for the text getting styling as a link inside the button. The purpose of the buttons was to prompt users to navigate to the next section of the website, offering a logical flow which would result in a sign-up. However, in the interest of time, we'll hide the buttons to reintroduce later.

### Link breaks vs CSS
Throughout the code, there are a few line breaks to provide additional spacing between elemenst. In the future, it would be worth the effort to see if in the interest of correctness, these line breaks could be replaced with proper padding and margin.
